# Telka Proxy üì∫

A simple yet powerful proxy server written in Python (Flask) that allows watching publicly available internet TV streams in players like VLC. The application automatically downloads a list of channels, intelligently searches for working sources, and provides a clear web interface for easy selection.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Clear Web Interface:** A list of all channels with logos, a search function, and a modern design.
-   **Automatic Updates:** The channel list is downloaded from a public JSON file and is always up-to-date.
-   **Intelligent Source Discovery:** The script automatically iterates through all available sources for a given channel until a working one is found.
-   **Stream Validation:** Actively validates found streams to avoid serving dead links.
-   **Persistent Cache:** Remembers which source worked for a channel and tries it first on the next request. The cache is saved to a file, so it persists even after a script restart.
-   **Multi-language Support:** The interface automatically displays in **English, Polish, or Czech** based on the user's browser language settings.
-   **M3U Export:** Provides an option to download a complete M3U playlist of all channels for use in IPTV players.
-   **Reverse Proxy Support:** Designed to run flawlessly behind Nginx Proxy Manager or a similar tool, automatically generating correct public URLs.
-   **Fallback Sources:** Automatically generates fallback source URLs for channels that are missing sources in the official list, based on their logo filename.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   `pip` (Python package manager)

### 1. Preparation

Clone the repository or download the project files into a single folder. Name the main script `telka_proxy.py`.

### 2. Install Dependencies

In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the following command to install all required libraries:

```bash
pip install Flask requests beautifulsoup4 Werkzeug
````

Alternatively, you can create a `requirements.txt` file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### 3\. Configuration (Optional)

Open the `telka_proxy.py` file. At the top, you can modify the following constants:

  - `HOST_ADDRESS`: Set to `"0.0.0.0"` to allow access from other devices on your network (recommended for Docker/proxy setups).
  - `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (default is `8080`).
  - `FALLBACK_EMBED_URL_TEMPLATE`: The template for generating fallback source URLs.

### 4\. Running the Server

In your terminal, run the script:

```bash
python telka_proxy.py
```

The server will start, and the terminal will display a confirmation and the address where it is accessible.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Open your browser** and navigate to the server's address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080` or `http://your.domain.com` if using a proxy).
2.  **Select a channel** from the list.
3.  **Copy the Link:** **Right-click** on the desired channel and choose **"Copy link address"** from the context menu. Do NOT left-click.
4.  **Open VLC Media Player.**
5.  **Paste the Link:** Press `Ctrl+N` (or `Cmd+N`) to open the "Open Network Stream" dialog. Paste the copied link (`Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`) and click "Play".

To get the complete playlist file, click the **"Export M3U"** button on the web page or navigate directly to the `/export.m3u` URL.

## üê≥ Advanced Deployment with Docker

For an easy and isolated setup, you can use Docker.

### `Dockerfile`

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your project folder with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight official Python image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file and install dependencies
# This step is cached to speed up future builds
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# The command to run the application
CMD ["python", "telka_proxy.py"]
```

### `requirements.txt`

Create a `requirements.txt` file with this content:

```
Flask
requests
beautifulsoup4
Werkzeug
```

### Running with Docker

Now you can build and run the application using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t telka-proxy .

# Run the Docker container
# This command also creates a persistent volume for the cache
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name telka-proxy-container -v ./cache:/app/cache --restart unless-stopped telka-proxy
```

*Note: The Python script is already configured to use a `./cache` subdirectory, so this volume mapping will work out of the box.*

## üîå Nginx Proxy Manager Setup

If you want to access the application via your own domain (e.g., `tv.yourdomain.com`):

1.  In Nginx Proxy Manager, create a new **Proxy Host**.
2.  Set the **Domain Name** to your desired domain.
3.  Set the **Forward Hostname / IP** to the IP address of the machine running the script/Docker container.
4.  Set the **Forward Port** to `8080`.
5.  Navigate to the **Advanced** tab and ensure the following options are enabled. This is crucial for dynamic URL generation in the M3U playlist.
      - ‚úÖ **Forward Hostname**
      - ‚úÖ **Forward Scheme**
